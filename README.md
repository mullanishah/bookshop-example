# bookshop-example
An assignment or sample project to study and utilize the Java IO (Input and output) operations. Here, we are considering an imaginary Bookshop system and trying to implement its features.  

In a nutshell, Java uses the concept of a Stream to make IO operations faster. A stream is a sequence of data that is composed of bytes. It is referred as a stream because it is a stream of water that continues to flow. The java.io package contains all the necessary classes and interfaces to carryout an input and output opeations. We can achieve the file handling in Java with help of IO APIs.
